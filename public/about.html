<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hi there! I am Vinit Yadav, a Master of Science in Information Systems candidate at Northeastern University.
   I also hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Mumbai University, where I graduated with Distinction and a GPA of 3.7.</p>

<p>In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C, 
  as well as web technologies and frameworks such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React JS, Redux, Node JS, Express JS, and REST API.
  I also have experience working with database management systems like MySQL, MongoDB, and MSSQL, 
  as well as software/tools like Visual Studio Code, Figma, Adobe XD, Axure, IntelliJ IDE, NetBeans, Git, Tableau, and Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<p>I have gained professional experience as an Information Technology Support Technician at Ram Agency, 
  where I provided technical assistance to staff, designed the user interface for their application using Figma, 
  developed a website for sales management using MERN stack, and created and maintained data for online databases and websites. 
  I also worked as a Data Science and Business Analyst Intern at The Sparks Foundation, 
  where I utilized unsupervised machine learning techniques to predict the optimum number of clusters for an Irish plant from a dataset, achieving a 95% accuracy rate. 
  Additionally, I was an Official Campus Ambassador Intern for the International Model United Nations Association (IMUNA), 
  where I promoted IMUN on campus, managed social media accounts to engage with interested students, and created marketing materials using Figma.</p>

<p>I have completed various academic projects, including a Vision Based System for Drowsiness Detection, where I generated a model using machine learning and 
    open CV to detect and recognize drowsiness based on facial expressions and prevent fatal accidents. I also developed a Credit Card Fraud Detection model, 
    which created separate legal transactions and fraudulent transaction patterns for each customer based on which it predicted fraudulent transactions. 
    Another project I worked on was an Employee Leave Management System, which was a web-based tool that automated the workflow of leave applications and approvals.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I have engaged in extracurricular activities such as organizing seminars and 
  interactions with entrepreneurs, investors, and professionals to encourage, inspire and nurture young students. 
  I have also coordinated various social events such as Blood Donation Camp, Cleanliness Drive, and Road Safety Awareness programs, 
  raising awareness in society. I have completed various certifications in courses such as digital marketing, IT Support Fundamentals,
  Relational Databases, Advanced MYSQL, and Python. Additionally, I achieved 37 badges in the Google Cloud Challenge on 
  Google Cloud Platform and managed technical events such as 'Tech Zephyr' of Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering as a Co-ordinating 
  member organized by 'Computer Society of India'.</p>
